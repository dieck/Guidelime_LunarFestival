[OC]If this line is grayed out, the guide has not started due to a bug. Please mark all checkboxes above and including this item. This might happen again after a reload / new login.

[OC]Please note that, as I play Alliance, I might have missed some optimazations of the routes for Horde. Please suggest improvements via Curse or Github! You may of course take different routes and use this guide to see if you missed any Elder.

[OC]This guide contains Instance Elders for Kalimdor. All should be soloable by a LVL 80 char. Skip if you want to do them in a group.
