[D Guide to Lunar Festival Elders of Kalimdor]
[OC]If this line is grayed out, the guide has not started due to a bug. Please mark all checkboxes above and including this item.

[OC]Please note that routes are slightly optimized for Alliance (as I play that), but Horde should be able to ride along everything as well. You may of course take different routes and use this guide to see if you missed any Elder.

[OC]This guide contains Instance Elders for Kalimdor. All should be soloable by a LVL 80 char. Skip if you want to do them in a group.
