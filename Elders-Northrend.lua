[OC]If this line is grayed out, the guide has not started due to a bug. Please mark all checkboxes above and including this item. This might happen again after a reload / new login.

[OC]This guide does NOT contains Instance Elders for Northrend. You will need a group for most, if not all.

[OC]This guide has no flight point hints, as I assume most people will use their own mounts anyway.

[OC]Start in Dalaran

[OC]If your Faction owns Wintergrasp, do that Elder in between.
