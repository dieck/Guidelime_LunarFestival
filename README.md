## Manual installation

Download release https://github.com/dieck/Guidelime_LunarFestival/releases
or clone from Git, 
so that _classic_\Interface\AddOns\Guidelime_LunarFestival\GuideLime_LunarFestival.toc exists (and of course all other files :))

Don't forget to install Guidelime addon (from Curse: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime)
Guidelime will need you to install Questie for these guides as well. (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie)
